         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are running currently the Amiex System but you want to change to the
FAME System, one of the main problems are the user.datas, because normally
you have to delete them or you must convert every user of your BBS to FAME
by hand...this could become a hard job when you have about 300 users like I
have in my BBS. UConvert is the right solution for this problem, as it is
able to convert all your Amiex User.datas into the FAME format and also copy
all neccessary settings, too, so the users won't notice that their accounts
have been moved (except that FAME has a lot more features no other BBS has),
because all Byte- and Filesettings, conference-accesses, level-settings,
calls etc. are copied to the FAME-Format. UConvert will set all deleted
users from your Amiex user.datas as Inactive, so they won't be deleted
when a Newuser enters the FAME!

NOTE: Amiex has a hard-core method to save the passwords of the users! The
      passwords will be crypted with an one-way algorithm, meaning that
      Amiex itself won't be able to decrypt the Password after saving it
      to the user.datas!! Because of this, UConvert will normally write as
      password for all converted users the name of the user. But we have
      managed it to solve this problem, too!! Before switching to FAME,
      built the AutoPW door into your Amiex System as Syscommand 'S', best
      way is to install it about one month before switching to FAME. This
      door is able to collect the Passwords from all users and store them
      in a seperate file. This file will then be readen and used by UConvert
      to fill in the passwords!!! See AutoPW.doc for further informations
      about this door.

New for V0.5:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some people had reported some mistakes during the Usage of UConvert...well
Strider and I have searched about three hours for any mistakes but found 
NOTHING strange! We have now set up additional features of FAME to Ask
state or simply switched them on. If you still have problems with this
program, please contact SieGeL/tRSi under siegel@deadline.snafu.de or call
my BBS and leave me a *FULL DETAILED BUG-REPORT WHAT IS WRONG DURING THE
CONVERTING OF YOUR USER.DATAS* !!! 
Otherwise I won't be able to fix anything !

                                  Usage:
                                  ~~~~~~

First make sure that no users are online when converting the user.datas,
because that may cause trouble during the convert process!

Start UConvert with the following arguments:

        UConvert <AMIEX_USER_DATA_PATH> <PATH_TO_CREATE_NEW_DATAS>

                         i.e.: UConvert BBS: RAM:

This will search for 'BBS:user.data', 'BBS:user.keys' and 'BBS:user.misc'
and convert all three datafiles to the FAME-datafiles 'RAM:user.data' and
'RAM:user.keys'. UConvert first checks the amount of users stored in your
Amiex user.datas and will then convert all users.
After it has been finished with the converting you will be asked if you have
the AutoPW door from ByteAndi/tRSi installed (See NOTE above for more
informations why this door is required). If you haven't installed it, enter
'N' at the prompt and UConvert will exit silently. You have to check then
the password of every user in the converted user.datas, because UConvert is
only able to write as Password the User's name if you don't have used AutoPW
before convert the user.datas. Don't blame me for this, Amiex itself won't
be able to decrypt it's own (!) passwords after crypting/saving them.

But if you have installed AutoPW and most of your users have entered their
Password, answer with 'Y' at the prompt and UConvert will now check out the
database AutoPW creates in BBS:user.pw and write all found passwords in the
according user.datas. During this procedure, UConvert prints out all users
including their slotnumbers for whom UConvert has found a password.
Users which haven't written their Password included in the AutoPW database
will be set to inactive state automatically, but *ONLY* when using AutoPW
and the AutoPW collector has collected from ALL your users !! If not, the
users which aren't included won't be touched from UConvert!

After finishing, you will now be able to use the converted user.datas
together with FAME ! Simply copy them to the place you've defined in the
SystemEditor of FAME, and everything works fine. You should also mail an
EALL for your users describing that you've changed to FAME and that they
should re-configure their settings to use the full power of FAME.

Have fun with your FAME-System,
